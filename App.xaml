            <!-- Any valid dictionaries can be added here to expose their resources globally.
            This is why I'm able to reference variables such as GentleHighlight in MainWindow.xaml
            and elsewhere. To add additional global dictionaries, just create another
            ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries containing a ResourceDictionary with a Source. 
            
            Load order is important — if a dictionary tries to reference a resource that is defined
            in another dictionary that is declared later, an exception will be thrown. This does not
            happen with DynamicResources, where value lookups occur during runtime when everything
            is already done loading. See Styles.xaml and Colors.xaml for more information.-->
